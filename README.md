# Static/Dynamic publisher

## About

A simple publisher app as lab.

It allows to add items and mark them to be published statically to show the
difference between those two approaches. The dynamic way is slowed down
artificially to make difference more visible

## How to run

You must have [vagga](vagga.readthedocs.io) installed.

If you have, simply run `vagga run` and it is all.
